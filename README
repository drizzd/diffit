	diffit - A git plugin for vim

This plugin is under development and may have serious bugs! The goal is to
support much of git-gui's features, and possibly more.

To install, copy diffit.vim to ~/.vim/plugin/diffit.vim .

To toggle diffit mode, use <Leader>d, where <Leader> is '\' by default.

Control keys:

 <Leader>d	toggle diffit mode
 s		stage hunk
 d		skip file

Have fun!
