*** diffit ***

This is a git plugin for vim. The plugin is under development and may have
serious bugs! The goal is to support much of git-gui's features, and possibly
more.

To install, copy diffit.vim to ~/.vim/plugin/diffit.vim .

To toggle diffit mode, use <Leader>d, where <Leader> is '\' by default.

Have fun!
